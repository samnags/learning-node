Node: Event driven / non-blocking I/O
- I/O is input/output. Communications between things
- non-blocking: one user can request one thing while another requests something else at same time


Modules - units of functionality

require
 - allows us to use modules that come bundle with Node
 - also allows us to load in third party libraries

export
- a method on the module object
- module.exports

nodemon
- terminal command that updates when you save
